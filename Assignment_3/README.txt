=======================================================================================================
Hardest part of the Assignment
1)Thinking and building the logic in Prolog.
2)Forgetting the DOT at the end gave me a hard time. As I was unable to figure out the error I was facing.
3)Another error that I faced was while trying to run the file as my file name had a Capital letter C (Cryptarithm). 
So, I was unable to run the file then I later figured out to give the file name in inverted commas ('Cryptarithm') and it worked and then I also changed my file name.
